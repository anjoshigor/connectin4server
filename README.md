# connectin4server
A simple Server application for the connectin4 project made with Node.js
## Objective:
make a server application with nodeJS containing the 2 functions:
* register
* ranking

This will be a server application for my client application [connectin4](https://github.com/joao-rafael/connectin4)

## Requests
The server must respond to requests defined on the [professor's website](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~zp/aulas/1819/tw/)
The server has, also, to verify if all the request arguments were received(and the types of the arguments as well)

## Responses
The responses that are going to be sent by the server have to follow the specification at the professor's website.
The server has to generate propper state resposnses, listed:
* 200 - OK
* 400 - Request error
* 401 - Not authorized(invalid nick/pass)
* 404 - Unknown request

## Server structure
The server must be strutured in node.js modules. These modules will agregate the functionalities and will hide details
from the others. 
The main server app wich will load the others modules, define the proccess function and start the server networking
has to be named as: **index.js**

## Persistence
The data has to be serialized in JSON and must be persisted by files, using the nodeJs FS module

## Hash, encrypt and identifiers
Each game has to have an identifier, that must be generated by data about it, including time.
The easiest way will be using the crypto mode for the gemeration of a MD5 hash value encoded in Hexadecimal.
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const hash = crypto
               .createHash('md5')
               .update(value)
               .digest('hex');
```
For security reasons, the _passwords_ must be encrypted before saved: use the crypto module to do it too.
